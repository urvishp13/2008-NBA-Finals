# 2008 NBA Finals Revisited

Okay. You made it! You're in the NBA Finals! Now it's time to beat your foe, the Los Angelos Lakers. If you look at the scoreboard, you will see two sides: ME and YOU. YOU are you and the Lakers are ME. This game will work how every basketball game works: you can dribble, shoot 3-pointers and 2-pointers, and defend against your opponent. But be careful‚Äîdon't get too loose with the ball or get to reckless with your defense. If you do, you may commit a turnover or a foul, respectively. However, so might your opponents üòç. Oh oh, the games about to start! That's it, you've been debriefed‚Äînow go out there and get them Tiger!

This project initially started with a design given by the Scrimba Frontend Development bootcamp.

The requirements were:<br>
‚úÖ Build from "scratch" (based off a Figma file)<br>
‚úÖ Follow the Figma file design<br>
‚úÖ Make 6 increment buttons functional<br>

Some stretch goals were:<br>
‚úÖ Add a "New Game" button<br>
‚úÖ Add a few more counters (eg. timer, period)<br>
‚úÖ Change the design<br>

My additions were:<br>
‚úÖ Turn into an interactive game that emulated a real basketball experience<br>
